# LungNoduleClassification
A full-cycle medical imaging pipeline that extracts and analyzes 2D and 3D radiomic features from CT scans to classify lung nodules. Utilizing the LIDC-IDRI dataset, this project benchmarks multiple feature selection techniques (Lasso, PCA, t-test) and ensemble classifiers (XGBoost, Random Forest) to optimize diagnostic sensitivity.
